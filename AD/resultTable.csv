The CDR scale is a clinician-rated dementia staging system that tracks the progression of cognitive impairment in 6 categories (memory, orientation, judgement, and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care). Each category is scored on a 5-point scale in which None = 0, Questionable = 0.5, Mild = 1, Moderate = 2, and Severe = 3. The global CDR score is established by clinical scoring rules and has values of 0 (no dementia), 0.5, (questionable dementia), 1 (mild dementia), 2 (moderate dementia), and 3 (severe dementia). The Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) is obtained by adding the ratings in each of the 6 categories and ranges from 0 to 18 with higher scores indicative of greater impairment.

The ADAS-cog11 is a widely accepted performance-based assessment of cognition used in clinical studies for the treatment of participants with AD.
The ADAS-cog11 (score range) consists of word recall (0-10) and word recognition memory tests (0-12), object and finger naming (0-5), commands (0-5), constructional praxis (0-5), ideational praxis (0-5), orientation (0-8), remembering test instructions (0-5), spoken language ability (0-5), comprehension of spoken language (0-5) and word finding difficulty (0-5).

There are various well validated IADL scales, but some are outdated as they do not assess current daily tasks.
The Amsterdam IADL Questionnaire (A-IADL-Q) is an adaptive and computerized questionnaire designed to assess impairments IADL in patients with cognitive decline due to mild dementia. The questionnaire is completed by a caregiver and consists of 70 items in 7 categories (time needed 20-25 minutes)., Baseline, Week 12, Week 26, Week 38, and Week 52|Change from baseline in CDR-SB score at Week 12, Week 26, Week 38, and Week 52, The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) is a 5-point global rating scale used to characterize 6 domains of cognitive and functional performance applicable to AD and related dementias: memory, orientation, judgment \& problem solving, community affairs, home \& hobbies, and personal care. The information needed to make each rating is obtained through a semi-structured interview of the participant and a reliable informant or collateral source (eg, family member). The CDR rater should be trained to administer the semi-structured interview and should be blinded to results of other assessments.
For each domain, a rating is assigned to quantify the severity of impairment/dementia (0=no impairment; 0.5=very mild impairment; 1=mild impairment; 2=moderate impairment; and 3=severe impairment). The sum of the ratings for the 6 domains is the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score., Baseline, Week 12, Week 26, Week 38, and Week 52|Clinical worsening, defined as ≥4 points change from baseline in the ADAS-cog11 score at Week 12, Week 26, Week 38, and Week 52, The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) consists of 2 parts, a cognitive subscale and a behavioral subscale.

It covers 12 domains.
The NPI is administered to the participant's caregiver and includes an integrated caregiver distress measure. For each domain, abnormal behavior is noted to be absent (score=0) or present. If present, the frequency (rarely=1, sometimes=2, often=3, and very often=4), severity (mild=1, moderate=2, and severe=3), and associated caregiver distress (0=not at all, 1=minimally, 2=mildly, 3=moderately, 4=severely, and 5=very severely or extremely) are to be rated.
The product of frequency and severity (maxi.=12) is calculated for each domain. A total NPI was the sum of the frequency and severity products (maxi. =144). A higher NPI score indicates a greater degree of behavioral disturbances., Baseline, Week 12, Week 26, Week 38, and Week 52|Change from baseline in MMSE score at Week 12, Week 26, Week 38, and Week 52, The MMSE is a brief test of cognitive function, defined as the sum of 11 items: orientation in time and place, registration, attention and concentration, recall, naming 2 objects, repetition, 3-stage command, reading, writing and copying.

It is an independent, semi-structured medical interview that is used to assess changes in the participant's condition during a clinical study. An independent, experienced, and properly trained rater will provide a global impression of the participant's condition based on separate interviews with the participant and caregiver.
The rater is not to elicit caregiver's opinion of the participant's condition but only factual information about the study participant's functioning.
The change from baseline in CIBIC-Plus is rated on a 7-point scale: 1=markedly improved, 2=moderately improved, 3 = minimally improved, 4=no change, 5=minimally worse, 6=moderately worse, and 7=markedly worse., Baseline, Week 12, Week 26, Week 38, and Week 52|Change from baseline in QoL-AD score at Week 26 and Week 52, The QoL-AD includes the participant's and caregiver's appraisal of the participant's physical condition, mood, interpersonal relationships, ability to participate in meaningful activities, financial situation, and an overall assessment of self as a whole and life quality as a whole.
